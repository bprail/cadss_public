Computer Architecture Design Simulator for Students

This repository contains a multi-component integrated simulator to support
computer architecture students writing simulation models of different
computer architecture components, such as caches, branch predictors, or
coherence protocols.  The provided code handles trace reading and
initialization of simple components.

Reference implentations are available upon request.

Other support code and files can be found at https://github.com/bprail/cadss_support.

At CMU, trace files are available in /afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15346-f22/public/traces/coher/

There is also a support video at https://youtu.be/O2Tir0LI2xY
